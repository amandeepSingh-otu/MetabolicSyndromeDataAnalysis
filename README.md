<h2 style="color:#006400;font-weight:bold; font-family: Open Sans, sans-serif; margin-bottom:5px;"> Introduction</h2>
<p style="font-size:medium">Metabolic syndrome is an accumulation of several disorders, which together raise the risk of an individual developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and diabetes mellitus, and vascular and neurological complications such as a cerebrovascular accident.

The repercussions of metabolic syndrome extend beyond immediate health concerns, serving as a precursor to more severe conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. As a pervasive health issue, particularly prevalent among U.S. adults, it has garnered global attention due to its association with increased morbidity and mortality rates.

Various factors come into play in determining an individual's susceptibility to metabolic syndrome. Notably, blood glucose levels, triglyceride levels, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are key indicators.
In this study, We will understand how factors like age, income, race, and gender relate to metabolic syndrome. By doing this, we hope to learn more about how individual health indicators and demographic factors interact.

<h5 style="color:#1E90FF;font-weight:bold">What question this study is going to explore and try to answer:</h5>
<ol style="font-size:medium">
<li>Does Income has any relation with development of metabiolic syndrome?</li>
<li>Does gender have any influence overall?</li>
<li>Does age has any influence on it and what biological factor changes most with age which can change the likehood of developing the Syndrome</li>
<li>Does Race of person affects the chances of developing the syndrome? Does different gender in different races have different impacts on the likelihood of developing the syndrome?  </li>
</ol>

<p style="font-size:medium">The data for the study is taken from Kaggle and the original data is from https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.html. Center for Disease control and Prevention do surveys under national Center for health statics and provide data on it's website. The units for the measurement of blood glucose, triglycerides, HDL, Uric Acid in the given data are mmol/L, mmol/L, mmol/L and micromol/L. The normal ranges for blood Glucose is 3.9 to 7.8 mmol/L, for HDL it's 1.3 mmolfor female and 1,0 mmol/L for males, for Triglyecerides it's less than 1.7 mmol/L. The normal range for Uric acid can vary depending on the lab, but it’s typically around 150 to 500 µmol/L for men and 75 to 350 µmol/L for women. The income in the data is monthly income for the family. The 0 in data denotes that the person don't have metabolic syndrome and 1 denotes that person have metabolic syndrome. </p>
